            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

And in deede they ſhould haue iuſt cauſe to be offended in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, if the reaſons which cauſe them to haue ſuch opinion of the holines thereof, were ſo certaine &amp; true as they thinke them to be, and cauſe them ſelues to beleue, for ſo much as they haue bene ſo
<pb facs="tcp:135550:2"/>inſtructed. For firſt they haue bene taught that it was inſtituted and celebrated by Ieſus Chriſte him ſelfe: and afterward continued by his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, &amp; conſequently by al their ſucceſſours from age to age, euen from the firſt inſtitution of the ſame euen vntil our time. And then they do conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the matter whereof al the pieces of the ſame are compoſed, the which they doe thinke to be all taken out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy Scripture, becauſe that ſome of thoſe pieces are taken from thence.

Beholde then three reaſons of very great apparauntes which they doe alledge for them ſelues, of the which the firſt is taken of the inſtitution of the Maſſe, and of the authour of the ſame: and the ſecond of his long continuance, which is as they thinke euen from the death and paſſion of Ieſus Chriſte vntill our age: &amp; the third is taken of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter of the good and holy wordes &amp; things whereof it is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poſed. If all theſe reaſons were true and well grounded vpon trueth, they were worthy of great accompt. For, for the firſt, how great a crime is it to reiect and condemne the ordinaunces of the Sonne of God? And afterward what a pride were it, to make ſo ſmall accompt of the common conſent of the whole Church of God, and of ſo many ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men, and of ſo long a time?

                  </argument>
                  <p>SEeing then that they alleadge ſuch reaſons, &amp; that they giue them ſo goodly a ſhewe, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth nowe to conſider whether they bee true or falſe. For if they be true, they haue then wonne their proceſſe. But if they be falſe, they may not finde it ſtraunge at all, if that a man doe diſcouer the falſhod which hindereth the knowledge of the truth of this matter. And therefore ſo farre forth as it toucheth the inſtitution of the Maſſe, and the authour of the ſame, we doe firſt aſke them what it is that they do vnderſtand by this word Maſſe: for if they vnderſtand by the ſame the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the holy ſupper of the Lorde, we will eaſely graunt them that Ieſus Chriſt him ſelfe did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute and adminiſter the ſame holy Sacrament, and gaue commaundement to his Apoſtles, and to all their true ſucceſſours to do the like, euen as he did in the inſtitution and adminiſtration of the

But if they vnderſtand by this worde Maſſe, ſuch a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice as is that which at this day is ſo called, in the Church that is called Catholike Romaine, wee do not onely then not graunt that Ieſus Chriſte did euer inſtitute that Maſſe, nor that euer the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles or their true ſucceſſours did euer celebrate ſuch an one, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which more is, we ſay, that ſo farre of it is that ſuch a Maſſe may be the holy ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the ſupper inſtituted by Ieſus Chriſt, that on the contrary, the ordinance of the Lorde is there wholy ouerthrowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with the whole forme of the holy ſupper and of the diuine ſeruice which hath alwayes bene obſerued in the true ancient Church, by meane of the reaſons which I will anon yeelde.</p>

                  <p>THus much touching the foundation of their firſt reaſon, which is the ſtrongeſt &amp; the moſt apparant that they haue. For if they cannot ſhew
<pb facs="tcp:135550:3"/>that their Maſſe is of the inſtitution of Ieſus Chriſt, and of the ordinance of God, it muſt then neceſſarily be placed amongſt the inuentions and traditions of men, by the which God him ſelfe doth witnes, not onely by the mouth of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Iſai,</hi>

                     </note> but alſo by that of his own ſonne Ieſus Chriſt, that he is ſerued in vaine. Wherefore, if this firſt foundation be already ouerthrowen, the ſecond which is founded vpon the ſame, will alſo be forthwith ouerthrowen. For if Ieſus Chriſt did not inſtitute ſuch a Maſſe, nor his Apoſtles &amp; their true ſucceſſors did euer celebrate or knowe ſuch an one, at the leaſt for the time of ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth yeres after the aſcenſion of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: where is that whereupon they will builde the auncientie thereof, and the long and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinual ſucceſſion, and the common and publique conſent of all the Church, for ſo long a time wherewith they make them ſelues ſo great a buckler? It is here then needefull to enquire, and to conſider what difference there is betweene the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſupper ordeined by Ieſus Chriſte, and that which is called the ſacrament of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar in the Romiſh Church, and how long time the holy ſupper of the Lorde did remaine whole and perfect, and when it began to be changed, corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ouerthrowen, and conuerted into the ſame faſhion that it nowe is in the Maſſe of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine Church. For their owne doctours can not
<pb facs="tcp:135550:4"/>deny but that ſince the time of Ieſus Chriſt and of his Apoſtles, and of the firſt and moſt auncient Chriſtian Church, they haue chaunged and added much to the firſt inſtitution of the Lord, and in the forme of the adminiſtration of this holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the which the Apoſtles did vſe. For this cauſe no one, but the moſt ſhameleſſe amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dare ſaye openly, that Ieſus Chriſt did ordeine &amp; make the Maſſe, but they ſaye that he gaue onely the matter, and that afterward the Church gaue it the faſhion by the ſucceſſours of the Apoſtles, &amp; chiefly by the Romaine Popes, wherein they doe greatly honour the ſonne of God. For if it be ſo, he did but rough hewe the worke, whereof he left the matter confuſed and euill poliſhed, as a firſt purtraiture rude and not poliſhed, leauing the thing to be better poliſhed, adorned and brought to perfection by thoſe which ſhould come after him, the which worke was not made perfect by one or twoo workmen only, but by a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber as they them ſelues do witneſſe. For they are not ſo ſhameleſſe that they dare affirme that it was made or perfected, neither by one workman onely, but by many, nor at one inſtant, nor at one onely time, but in ſundry ages.</p>
